# Second Keyboard scripts
AutoHotKey scripts for running second (and more) keyboards for macros or remapping.

This repo started its life when Taran started playing around with additional keyboards for macros. In his repo there are a lot of scripts that he uses on daily basis. However for a person that doesn't use Adobe Premiere or doesn't want to use other scripts that the most basic ones for the second keyboard its hard to find the stuff in his.

That's why I created this fork with stuff that is basic. Additionally I'm planning to put here my scripts that I find useful or that I have written.

Right now there is the most basic script for running second keyboard and my script for remapping numpad.

If your new to all of this watch [the videos made by Taran](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH1gH0v9E3ruYrNyRbHhDe6XDfw4sZdZr).
